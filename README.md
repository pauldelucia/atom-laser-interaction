# atom-laser-interaction
This notebook is made to explore how a single hydrogen atom
(an electron bound to a proton) behaves inside a laser beam.

To simulate a laser beam, two 'infinitely long', oppositely charged barriers
will be placed in parallel, between which the hydrogen atom will sit.
This simulates the classical view of a laser beam - an oscillating electric
field.
